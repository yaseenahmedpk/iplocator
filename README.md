### Installation

```bash
composer require bytes4sale/iplocator
```
## Prerequisites

Before using IPLocator, you need to sign up for an API key from the IP data providers you wish to use. IPLocator currently supports the following IP data providers, each offering different sets of information. So key is required to access their API to fetch IP information

1. IPDATA : You can register and obtain your API key by visiting their website at [https://www.ipdata.co](https://www.ipdata.co).
2. IPSTACK : You can register and obtain your API key by visiting their website at [https://ipstack.com](https://ipstack.com).


## Configuration
Before using the IPLocator package, you need to set your API key and API Source in the .env file of your Laravel project.

1. Open your Laravel project's root directory.
2. Create or modify the `.env` file and add:

```php
//for IPDATA
IP_LOCATOR_SOURCE=IPDATA
IPDATA_KEY=your_ipdata_api_key_here,

//for IPSTACK
IP_LOCATOR_SOURCE=IPSTACK
IPSTACK_KEY=your_ipstack_api_key_here,
```

## Usage

Getting information for an IP address is a breeze with IPLocator. Simply follow these steps:

1. **Initialize IPLocator**: Before using the package, make sure to initialize it. You can do this by adding the `ServiceProvider` to the `config/app.php` file:

   ```php
   // config/app.php
   
   'providers' => [
       // Other providers...
       bytes4sale\iplocator\IPLocatorServiceProvider::class,
   ],

2. **Retrieve IP Information**: Once the package is initialized, you can easily get the details for an IP address:

   ```php
    use bytes4sale\iplocator\Facades\IPLocator;
   
   // Get information for an IP address
    $ipAddress = '203.0.113.0';
    $response  = IPLocator::getIpCompleteDetails($ipAddress);
    if ($response->isSuccessful()) {
        print_r($response->getTodayRequestCount());
         
        } else {
            print_r($response->getErrorResponse();
        }
### Configuration

IPLocator allows you to customize its behavior by publishing its configuration file. To do this, run the following artisan command:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="iplocator-config"
```

After running the command, you will find the configuration file at config/iplocator.php. You can modify the settings as per your needs.
# Advanced Settings

If you want to save the API keys in the database, you can use the `IpLocatorConfig::setCredentials(["key" => "123"])` function to set the API key. Make sure the array key should be "key".

This allows you to securely store and manage your API keys within your application's database, providing a more flexible and configurable way to use the IpLocator package.
